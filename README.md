# StartingWithLua
With this project I want to start learning Lua so in the `src` folder you will find some modules where I will upload the explanation of the exercise and also the code of the solution. Please, feel free to fork the repository and contribute to improve solutions with optimizations and suggestions.

Also you have a JSON file called `tasks.json` where I include a task to run your code and test it. The idea is to provide a start point, feel free to customized it by your own and build your own tool change.

Clarify that the main reason to use Lua 5.1 is because the goals is to develop games in LÃ–VE2D which use Lua 5.1.
